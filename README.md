# EF Plane SLAM Back-end Benchmark

This repository contains all required scripts and notebooks to compare quality of different SLAM Backends
using planes as landmarks.

## Data
As the data source we provide two variants: [EVOPS dataset](https://evops.netlify.app)
and synthetic planar poses generator from [mrob](https://github.com/prime-slam/mrob) library.

## Supported backends
For comparison needs two algorithms except origin EF backend are implemented in **mrob** library. They are:
* [Pi-Factor](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~kaess/pub/Zhou21ral2.pdf)
* [Bareg](https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.02976)
* [EF]() Eigen Factors

## Evaluations
You can see examples of backend comparisons in two Python notebooks: 
* `eval_icl.ipynb` --- example of backend comparison on data from EVOPS dataset (sequence based on [ICL NUIM](https://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~ahanda/VaFRIC/iclnuim.html) Living Room kt0 trajectory)
* `eval_synthetic.ipynb` ---  example of backend comparison on synthetic data generated by `CreatePoints` method from **mrob** library

## Metrics
To compare SLAM backends predicted trajectories on perturbed origin poses are compared with ground truth poses using classic `ape` and `rpe` metrics.
